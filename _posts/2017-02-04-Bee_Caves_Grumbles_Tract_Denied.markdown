Bee Caves Grumbles Tract Denied

http://www.statesman.com/news/local/bee-cave-council-denies-128-acre-subdivision-grumbles-tract/yhLiIvFg4kNjowIXH1w0AI/

The Bee Cave City Council denied a development agreement to place a single-family rural subdivision on the 128.3-acre tract off of Hamilton Pool Road known as the Grumbles tract, reasoning the 74 planned lots were not far enough apart to strike as “rural” a tone as the zoning designation would imply.

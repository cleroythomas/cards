Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, Orlando, and Philadelphia are the five winners of the Smart Cities Council Readiness Challenge Grant program. Each city will receive a tailored readiness workshop to help them develop a roadmap for applying smart technologies to further innovation, inclusion, and investment within their cities.

"Breaking down the departmental silos is a key challenge in developing a smarter city. Each of the winning cities has demonstrated the ability to work across departments to solve problems," said Smart Cities Council Chairman Jesse Berst. "Our coalition of world-class experts looks forward to working with each of these enterprising cities to help them make smart use of technology to become more livable, workable, sustainable, and resilient."

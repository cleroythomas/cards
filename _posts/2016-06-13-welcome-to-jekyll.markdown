Plan Houston was recently approved by the Houston Planning Commission and released on the the website http://planhouston.org/ . Described as “Houston's first general plan” the plan consists of 12 core strategies and related action items. It is my contention that this document is categorically different from what is described as a general or comprehensive plan in the urban planning literature and as is seen in what is called a general plan in other cities. This is not intended as a criticism. This document is closer to what is sometimes referred to as a “visioning” or “statement of goals” document and as such it could provide a powerful basis for a more comprehensive plan in the future.

There are three fundamental differences between Plan Houston and what is often referred to as a general plan, comprehensive or strategic city plan and these differences severely impact its effectiveness as a “plan” that can actually be enacted. The first is that there is nothing in Plan Houston or in the legal code pertaining to it that is “prescriptive”, meaning that there is no mechanism for enforcing the goals enumerated in the plan.

The second difference is related to the first. There is no timeline associated with the plan. Often general plans enumerate steps in a 5,10 and 20 year time frames depending on the stated goal. These time frames are often tied to specific budgetary items in a Capital Improvement Program (CIP). A CIP is a shorter range plan which lays the specific infrastructure items to be addressed along with the budgeting goals and financing options for those goals in the general plan. This ties the items in the general plan to the city's annual budget and sets the agenda for the continued improvement of infrastructure in a city in a way that ensures full public participation and holds decision makers accountable for the completion of those items in way that can be judged by the constituency.

The third difference with Plan Houston and more traditional general plans are the items in Plan Houston that the city has no purview over. There is no legal mechanism for ensuring “healthy, active lifestyles and social well-being” or “social ties supported by social, civic, and faith organizations” (nor should there be). These items should made into a separate plan maybe as an agenda for interested non-profits. While these are worthy goals (and easily agreed to) the city should only plan for those policy items that can be worked out through the democratic process and that it can legally enforce through ordinance. Otherwise these items diffuse the effectiveness of the efforts directed toward enacting those items that the city legally has the means and responsibility to address.

It’s important that the specific next steps be part of a CIP or added as an addendum to this plan at a later date. Otherwise it’s easy to imagine a situation where this “plan” is used as a way to forestall more effective legislation that holds public officials accountable. This plan has provided the vision for a more specific plan. Now we need the specific items and specific timeline for the equitable improvement of infrastructure items like drainage and transportation improvements in a way that ensures a balanced budget and fair distribution of the city’s resources. Please note comprehensive planning does not require zoning or land use regulation.

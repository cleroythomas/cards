<b>Welcome to CityPlanningTech.com</b> This is a blog dedicated to Urban Planning Issues in Austin and Houston along with emerging Urban Planning Technologies. 

I will also be displaying some portfolio items from [http://charlesleroythomasjr.tech/]http://charlesleroythomasjr.tech/

I plan on using the site for news aggregation on planning issues in Austin along with providing maps and data visualizations of my own of those issues

Come back soon I will be building the site out over 1/25/17 and 2/1/17
